<h3>1. What is Nao?</h3>
Nao is a constructed language project. Its motto is "Use thinking rather than memorizing". It allows one to build most words from logical pieces so that everybody who understands the rules will agree on the meaning.

<h3>2. Why should I take part in Nao project?</h3>
Do you think there’s a language or cultural barrier when you are talking with foreigners? When learning a foreign language, are you tired of all of the exceptions? Are you sick of the confusing grammar that doesn’t make sense? Does it frustrate you when you have to memorize thousands of words with many vague meanings? Does the difficult pronunciation drive you crazy? If so, it is actually not your fault. The problem is that languages have evolved quite chaotically. Nobody just sat down and thought them through. If the humankind wants a good language, it has to design it, like it has designed all the other technological things that we use today.

When two people with different languages and cultural backgrounds try to talk, huge misunderstandings take place (often hard to notice). Many people spend years learning English and yet don’t achieve good language proficiency, while most people stop learning in the very beginning. Nao, on the other hand, erases all the barriers between cultures thanks to its clear structure in the vocabulary and grammar, so it’ll take you way less time to master it and reach such a level of fluency that you would never reach learning a foreign language. There’s also a philosophical reason to learn Nao: it helps see the world the way it is, rather than hiding the truth behind vague words as most languages often do.

<h3>3. What’s unique about Nao?</h3>
Nao has a unique powerful rich system of <i>logical</i> word construction. It allows one to reach a better level of expressiveness and clarity, and at the same time master the language way faster than any natural language. Here you can see the <a href="comparison-with-esperanto.html">comparison with Esperanto</a>.
<h3>4. What does Nao sound like?</h3>
Speaking of pronunciation, one could find Nao to be similar with Japanese or Spanish. It has the same 5 vowels and almost the same consonants. Most often words end in a vowel. There are few consonant clusters, but quite a lot of vowel clusters.

<h3>5. What about the grammar of Nao?</h3>
If you have logical thinking, then you will love Nao. The vocabulary is highly logical and systematic which allows one to master it not only much faster but also reach a high level of fluency. Nao has no declensions, no conjugations. All forms are regular. The system of tenses is rich but not obligatory. By default, the word order is predetermined but the system of markers allows you to make any word order in the sentence that you wish for.

<h3>6. Is Nao based on any language?</h3>
Not really. Unlike many other auxiliary languages, Nao is a completely independent and yet very powerful language. Unlike any natural language, it is culturally neutral and universal. The only thing that all the people in the world share is logic and common human concepts, so it is exactly what is put into the basis of Nao, uniting all people and bringing clarity and mutual understanding.

<h3>7. How many words are there in Nao?</h3>
Technically infinite. It’s like asking “How many sentences are there in English?”. Just like the grammar of English allows you to generate an infinite number of sentences, the grammar of Nao goes to the next level and allows you to generate an infinite number of words. So for example, if you know around 300 elementary words in Nao, you'll be able to reach better expressiveness than knowing the top 6000 most common words in English.

<h3>8. Can I build my own words?</h3>
Again, it’s like asking “Can I create my own sentences in English?”. Yes, you can. In fact, all the non-elementary words you see in the dictionary are just recommendations, they do not have any special status, so the words that you make are just as good and valid as the ones you see in the dictionary, as long as you are logical and follow the rules of word construction.

<h3>9. If this language constructs all the words from the elementary ones, how did you decide which words would be the elementary ones?
</h3>
It took me thousands of hours of hard work to determine which words should be the elementary ones. Using common sense, I tried to disassemble every word to logical pieces. However, even if the concept can be constructed, I can still have an elementary word for it because it is very frequent and thus should be short.

<h3>10. How do you decide how to construct a certain word? After all, everybody’s different, everybody thinks differently, everybody sees the world differently.</h3>
Nobody decides anything. Instead, words are discovered, just like formulas are discovered in mathematics. The language has clear certain rules on word construction, and everything derives from there. Also, if two people think of the same word in different ways, it means that they put different meanings or different nuances to them, so obviously they might have different solutions, and it’s okay as long as everything follows the rules.

<h3>11. But the language is a living thing. Isn't all this "logicalness" going to be destroyed as the language is used?
</h3>
In the modern era of information it has become very easy to maintain and control languages. If we look 100 years back, many languages have not changed much thanks to the popularity of the language and its usage in mass media. Nao is even easier to remain stable for a few reasons: firstly, because any change (whether related semantics or pronunciation) will stick out because of its irregularity causing a chain reaction changing everything related to it which will be so noticeable bringing chaos so it will be impossible to use. Secondly, Nao is nobody’s native language, it's a helpful logical second language. Logic and prescriptivism will always be the priority. Think of it as a standard version of a programming language. The authority will edit it little by little over time (mostly adding something new) following human needs. Sure there might be some slang, but most of it will come and go.
