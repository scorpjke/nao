<li>
Esperanto has great potential for word construction. Nevertheless, it has a countless number of roots that could be expressed through other roots without losing any meaning. For example:
<p>
studento – lernulo<br>
hospitalo – kuracejo<br>
kuraci – sanigi<br>
murdi − mortigi<br>
oftalmologo – okulisto<br>
</p>

We can find thousands of such examples. Esperanto dictionaries contain tens of thousands of roots. Memorizing all of them is a big barrier for mastering the language. Nao aims to avoid excessive roots, i.e. those that can be constructed from the simpler ones. It's worth noting, however, that in Esperanto in many cases words would get too long and hard to pronounce because the Esperanto roots on average are quite long. In Nao every root consists of one syllable which allows for constructing words consisting of a long chain of roots.

<p> Quite often Esperanto doesn't use word construction where it would dramatically help memorization. For example, the names of months and days of the week can be constructed from the numbers (like in Chinese and Vietnamese). Nao follows that strategy.
</p>

<p> In Esperanto one can often see a group of roots that are close in meaning. For example, the roots <b>komik-, rid-, komedi-, ŝerc-</b> all describe closely related concepts but are completely unrelated gramatically. In Nao, all those concepts are logically constructed from the elementary word <b>hal</b> = «laugh».
</p>

<p>
ridi = hal<br>
komika = dohal (<i>such that is laughed at</i>)<br>
komedio = diohal (<i>funny story</i>)<br>
ŝerci = tuanehal (<i>aim to make laugh</i>)<br>
</p>

One more example: the roots <b>tim-, kuraĝ-, danĝer-, sav-, sekur-, protekt-, defend-, gard-, risk-, minac-, rifuĝ-</b> in Nao can be constructed from the elementary word <b>bun</b> = «be in danger».</p>

<p>
timi → nabun (<i>experience a feeling/emotion signalizing about being in danger</i>)<br>
kuraĝa → peunabun (<i>prone to not be scared</i>)<br>
savi → nenogabun (<i>cause to not be in complete danger</i>)<br>
sekura → dobin (<i>such that one is not in danger from</i>)<br>
protekti/defendi → nebin (<i>cause to not be in danger</i>)<br>
riski → fasebun (<i>do actions such that oneself is in danger</i>)<br>
singarda → tuabin (<i>aim to not be in danger</i>)<br>
rifuĝejo → mabin (<i>a specialized place for being safe</i>)
</p>

<p>This way, the number of elementary words in Nao is much lower but the expressing ability is not at all inferior to Esperanto.
</p>
</li>
<li> In Esperanto, the male gender of the word is often in-built in the word by default and can be changed to female by applying the suffix -in-. This is inconvenient and rightly leads to critisism. In Nao, no word contains information about the gender; instead, the gender is specified separately with words <b>mi</b> = «female», <b>mu</b> = «male». For example:

<p>
	pau = parent<br>
	mipau = mother<br>
	mupau = father<br>
</p>
<p>
	paikio = nephew/niece<br>
	mipaikio = niece<br>
	mupaikio = nephew<br>
</p>

<p> Another word worth noting is <b>data</b> literally meaning "that person" - it is a gender-neutral equivalent of «he/she».
</li>
<li>
<p> Often the roots in Esperanto have a vague meaning or a lot of meanings. The situation also gets worse when people under the influence of their own cultural and linguistic background start putting their own nuances into the words, especially in abstract words. For example, in some dictionaries it is written that <b>studento</b> means "student" while in many other dictionaries it is translated as "university student" and "academic". In Nao, each word only has one meaning and such ambiguity is impossible because the number of elementary words is small and each of them is strictly defined, while the combination meaning is strictly derived from the elements.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> Esperanto uses 23 consonants while Nao only uses 14. Also, consonants clusters are easier and much less frequent in Nao. It makes Nao easier to pronounce, especially for Asian people. Moreover, all Nao letters are standard Latin alphabet which facilitates typing and doesn't scare away beginners.</p>
</li>
<li>
Esperanto grammar has some unpleasant moments:

<ol class="al">
<li> Antonyms are built with the prefix mal-; that's long and causes a lot of critisism. In Nao, the antonym is built with alternating i/u. <br>For example: li = bona, lu = malbona</li>
<li> The definite article <b>la</b> which shouldn't be in an international language at all. Nao doesn't use definite or indefinite articles. </li>
<li> The accusative ending <b>-n</b> gives headache to a lot of people. Nao has an accusative marker but it is optional (used only in case of non-standard word order).</li>
<li> 
	The omnipresent <b>estas</b> that we see in almost every sentence is long and annoys many people. In Nao, the copula <b>bio</b> is shorter and is allowed to omit if the sentence remains clear.</li>
<li> The tense suffixes <b>-is,-as,-os</b> are mixed up by many people because of high similarity. In Nao, the verb tense is not obligatory as in most situations it is clear from the context.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>	
	<p> Esperanto doesn't have official transliteration rules to other languages. As a result, we have chaos when the same name can be written in many different ways in Esperanto. For example, the Russian name Евгения
→ Jevgenija, Evgenija, Evgenia, Eŭgenija,...; 香港 → Honkongo / Hongkongo; 西安 → Ŝjiano / Siano; Houston → Hjustono / Hustono / Houstono. Often the names are not transliterated at all even if some letters are not even a part of the Esperanto alphabet. This creates a lot of confusion with how to type and pronounce them. Adding "o" to loan words which is required by Esperanto grammar often looks quite silly, too. On the contrary, Nao has <a href="transliteration-rules.html">official transliteration rules</a> for each language. Thus, each proper noun has only one correct way of writing.</p>
