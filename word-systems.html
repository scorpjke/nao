<li>Expressing numbers
<ol class="al"><li>
Numbers are expressed by reading out its digits from left to right.
</li><li>
 The number is placed before the noun to describe the number of objects.
</li><li>
To express decimal fractions, use the word <b>dot</b>: <R>tuidotjafos</R> = 3.14
</li><li>
To express big and little fractional numbers, one can use scientific notation: <b>jadotfospet puset</b> (= <b>1.45pu7</b>) means 1.45*10<sup>7</sup> or 14,500,000</li><li>
Negative numbers are expressed using <b>has</b>: <R>hasdua</R> = -2 (negative two)
</li></ol>
<li>Colors can be expressed describing the hue, luminosity and saturation <a href="colors.html">(see the color wheel)</a>:
<ol class="al">	
<li>The full color spectrum is defined on the scale [0;6): <b>ha0</b>=red, <b>ha1</b>=yellow, <b>ha2</b>=green, <b>ha3</b>=cyan, <b>ha4</b>=indigo blue, <b>ha5</b>=magenta.</li>
<li>Luminosity is expressed with <b>lai/lau</b>=light/dark plus an optional number from 0 to 9. If the luminosity is not mentioned at all, it is in range of <b>lau5</b> and <b>lai5</b>. Otherwise, if the value is not mentioned, it is in range of [5,10)</li>
<li>Saturation is expressed with <b>bul/bil</b>=strong/weak plus an optional number from 0 to 9. If the saturation is not mentioned at all, it is in range of <b>bil5</b> and <b>bul5</b>. Otherwise, if the value is not mentioned, it is in range of [5,10).</li>
<li>Then we can add extra digits (0-9) to make the parameter more specific: <b>ha00</b>=pure red, <b>ha05</b>=orange, <b>ha07</b>=gold, etc. Same with luminosity and saturation.</li>
</ol>
</li>

<li>
Using numbers with words for relatives:
<ol class="al">
<li><R>pau2</R> = <b>paupau</b>, <R>pau3</R> = <b>paupaupau</b>, etc. Same for <b>pai</b>
</li><li>
<R>kio2</R> = <b>paikiopau</b>, <R>kio3</R> = <b>pai2kiopau2</b>, etc.
</li><li>
<b>kio</b> without any number only refers to <b>kio1</b>. Same for <b>pau</b>.
</li><li>
The word <R>tia</R> is used to refer to the family of one's parent's spouse: <R>mupautia</R> = step-father, <R>mipauduatia</R> = step-grandmother (step-parent's mother), etc.
</li>
</ol>
</li>

<li> <b>buten</b>=<i>arm</i> is divided into parts from 0 to 5 (buten0...buten5, from the shoulder to the hand, respectively). Same for <b>bugo</b>=<i>leg</i>.
</li>

<li>
Words for dishes are made by listing the ingridients (from most to least important). Way of cooking can be mentioned at the end. For example, <R>mespottomfes</R> implies that meat is the biggest/most important ingridient and tomatoes are the smallest/least important, and all of that has been fried together. Use <b>ko</b> to show that things have been cooked separately. For example, <R>potkoliasfes</R> implies that potatoes and fish have been cooked separately: fish has been fried while it is not mentioned how exactly the potatoes have been cooked.
</li>

<li>
Use <R>tam</R>=<i>atom</i> and numbers to make the words for chemical elements (by referring to the number of protons). For example, <b>tamsetnef = tam79</b> = <i>gold</i>
