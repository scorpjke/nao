				Nao is a new artificial language with the following features:
				<div style="padding: 10px 50px">
					1. Requires thinking rather than memorization<br>
					2. Easy and logical grammar<br>
					3. Easy spelling and pronunciation<br>
					4. Truly neutral (the words and grammar are not based on those of any existing language)<br>
				</div>
				When you learn a foreign language, one of the most frustrating things is the fact that you have to memorize so many words. That stops many people from mastering the language or even learning the language at all. You get frustrated because you have to use the dictionary all the time, and the words just don’t stay long in your head.
				<br>
				Nao, however, doesn’t have that problem. The main feature of Nao is the fact that you don’t have to memorize thousands of words. In Nao, most words are built logically from the elementary words. If you know elementary words and the rules of combining, you can compound them in a very easy way, for example:<br>
				<div style="padding: 10px 50px" >
					<b class="g">bu</b> = <b>bodypart</b><br>
					<b class="g">kan</b> = <b>see / look</b><br>
					--------------------------<br>
					<b class="g">bukan</b> = <b>eye</b><br>
				</div>
				So, you don’t actually have to memorize <b class="g">bukan</b>, you just have to get used to it which is much much easier.
				Now that you know how to make <i>eye</i> it’s easy to guess how you build <i>ear</i> or <i>leg</i>. Nao is very consistent and logical when it concerns word construction.

				So, knowing 300 elementary words in Nao would be roughly the same as knowing 10000 words in English! You can see the table of the elementary words in the main page of the dictionary.
				<br>
				One of the most important tricks in Nao is to build the antonym.<br>
				All you need to do is to alternate i/u at the end. For example:<br>
				<div style="padding: 10px 50px" class="container" >
					<div class="dq9rq">
						<b class="g">li</b> = <b>good</b><br>
						<b class="g">lu</b> = <b>bad</b>
					</div>
					<div class="dq9rq">
						<b class="g">hagalai</b> = <b>white</b><br>
						<b class="g">hagalau</b> = <b>black</b><br>
					</div>
					<div class="dq9rq">
						<b class="g">dobun</b> = <b>dangerous</b><br>
						<b class="g">dobin</b> = <b>safe</b><br>
					</div>
					<div class="dq9rq">
						<b class="g">soinienai</b> = <b>summer</b><br>
						<b class="g">soinienau</b> = <b>winter</b><br>
					</div>
