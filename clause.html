		Clause is a special type of a top-word. It opens a whole new subsentence with its owns predicates, top-adverbs, etc.<br> When following a top-noun or a top-adjective, it modifies the top-noun. In other cases it works as a normal noun, becoming either the subject or the object.<br>
		<br>
		Special prepositions that open a clause:
		<b>hoi</b>=because(of),
		<b>hoic</b>=resulting in,
		<b>keo</b>=but,
		<b>keoc</b>=although,
		<b>sei</b>=if,
		<b>seic</b>=then.<br>
		When they open a clause, it should be thought as if there was a hidden <b>pe</b> right after them.<br>
		<h2 class="e">pe clause</h2>
		If inside a <b>pe</b> clause there is the wh-question word <b>ke</b>=what, the whole construction works like a function returning the answer to that question. For example, we have the wh-question <b>mic tuo pike</b>=<i>"where do you work?"</i>. Now if we put <b>pe</b> before it, it becomes <b>pe mic tuo pike</b>=<i>"the place where you work"</i>.
